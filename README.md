# Surfs_up
## Overview
An analysis was performed on weather trends for Oahu to determine if this locations is suitable for opening a surf and ice cream shop.  Additional research was performed on June and December to see if the shop would be sustainable year round. 
## Results
The following charts and tables will give you an idea of how the weather is in Oahu year round as well as statistics for the both June and December.

Looking at the precipitation graph below, we can see a range of dates starting with 08-23-2016 through 2017. This graph shows that precipitation does fluctuate but stays pretty low for the most part, with only a few large spikes that would cause for slow business.

When you take the following two months weather statistics the average temp for the months are between 71 and 75 with the max being 85 and below. Given this information the surf shop would do well year round and even during a cooler month ice cream would be a hit.

## Summary
In summary, Oahu would be a perfect location for the shop. With the temperatures staying in a good range for selling ice cream, the only thing to take in to account is the amount of rain. While the precipitation is generally low the high points are something to look for and plan for those slower days. When looking for a place in Oahu I would recommend thinking about higher traffic areas for people on vacation. This would allow for more people to locate and purchase from the shop with out having to travel too far. Once a location for the shop has been selected, it would be a good idea to run the analysis again on a station that is close by. This would give you a better understanding of how the weather acts in the location so you can plan the year out accordingly.
